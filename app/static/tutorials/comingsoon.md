==========

I began making this site with the intent to learn [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and web application development. 
After meeting a few milestones, I began to think that I should share my projects and tutorials with you all for a few
reasons:

* people can read and rate my code, letting me know where I can improve
* after spending many frustrating hours on certain problems, if my tutorial can help at least one other, then it will be
a success

I could write the tutorials in HTML, have them hardcoded in my site, and push them to my site whenever I write a new one, 
but that seems really sloppy and worth more time and effort than I'd like to spend. I'd rather be spending time writing
the actual tutorials.

To me, it seemed that my best option would be to add a login and administrator page that only I can access. From there,
I can upload Markdown files. The server will then display all tutorials in chronological order or you can view them by
tag, which will be given when the tutorial is submitted.

I'm in the middle of the tutorial at the moment. I've added upload and Markdown display capabilities but still need to
add the admin, login, and tag functionality. 

Check back soon for my first tutorial on web application development.
